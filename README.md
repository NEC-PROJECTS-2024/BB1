### INTRODUCTION
pneumonia, a serious lung infection. This is what deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence (AI), is being developed to diagnose pneumonia, but interpreting them can be difficult and time-consuming. Deep learning can analyze these X-rays and learn to recognize patterns that suggest pneumonia, much like how we recognize faces. This could make diagnosing pneumonia faster, more accurate, and available in more places. Early studies look promising, with deep learning models performing as well as doctors in some cases. Researchers are constantly improving these models and even exploring their use in diagnosing other diseases. With continued development, deep learning has the potential to revolutionize how we diagnose and treat pneumonia, making it a simpler process for everyone.
